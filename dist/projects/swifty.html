  <h1>Swifty</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/daz4126/swifty">source code</a></p>
<p>A static site generator that uses Turbo to make a page navigation almost instant. </p>
<p>Itâ€™s perfect for building personal or small business sites and can also be used to create a simple blog. </p>
<p>I was inspired  by a talk at Haggis Ruby about Bridgetown and have also utilized the Rails concept of convention over configuration in its design (for example if a layout has the same name as a directory then all pages in that directory will get that layout).</p>
<p>This site is built using Swfity!</p>
