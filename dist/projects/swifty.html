  <h1>Swifty</h1>
<p>A static site generator that uses Turbo to make a page navigation almost instant. It’s perfect for building personal or small business sites and can also be used to create a simple blog.  I was inspired  by a talk at Haggis Ruby about Bridgetown and have also utilized the Rails concept of convention over configuration in its design (for example if a layout has the same name as a directory then all pages in that directory will get that layout).</p>
