  <h1>Surge</h1>
<p>Surge is a tiny, ultra-lightweight JavaScript library that adds a surge of reactivity to your HTML — all in just 1kb (minified and gzipped).</p>
<p>No virtual DOM. No build step. No dependencies. Just drop it in and go.</p>
<p>Ever wonder why it takes 50kb of JavaScript, a virtual DOM, and a mountain of boilerplate just to build a counter?</p>
<p>With Surge, it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Surge embraces the simplicity of the web and the power of HTML-first development. It supercharges your HTML with a sprinkle of declarative magic using data-* attributes — no JSX, no diffing and no dependencies. Just clean, semantic HTML — with a surge of reactiviey.</p>
<p>⚡️ Two-way binding — Update your data or your UI, and both stay in sync ⚡️ Action binding with parameters — Easily wire logic to events like click, input, or submit ⚡️ LocalStorage support — Persist state with zero config ⚡️ Reactive HTML insertion — Dynamically add content and Surge wires it up automatically</p>
<p>Surge doesn&#39;t fight the browser — it works with it. HTML is your template and JavaScript is your logic. Surge brings them together in a powerful way then gets out of your way to let you build. And it&#39;s so small you&#39;ll hardly even know it&#39;s there.</p>
<p>Surge is built with simplicity in mind. Whether you’re prototyping, enhancing a static site, or building a micro-app, Surge gives you the power to be productive — without the weight of a full framework.</p>
