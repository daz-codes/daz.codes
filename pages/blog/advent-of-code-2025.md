I'd never heard of Advent of Code before I joined Yozu, so this was the second time I had taken part in trying to complete the challenges. Last year I achieved 42/50 of the stars available.

The 2025 Advent of Code changed the format a little bit from the year before. There were only 12 days of challenges rather than the usual 25. These took place from December 1st to December 12th, so there was still one every day and it was a tough pace to keep up with. Each day still had a part a (usually quite easy) and part b (harder with varying degrees of difficulty), with a star awarded for completing each part, making a total of 24 stars available this year.

I liked this new format - it has a nice link to the Twelve Days of Christmas and made it much more manageable to keep up with the challenges. It also meant there was more time to complete any unfinished challenges in the weeks before Christmas

This year I decided to use Ruby Monkey to complete all of the challenges.
Loved it - some really nice Code

Days 9 and 10 were ridiculously hard.
