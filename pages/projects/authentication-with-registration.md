 After giving a talk on the new Authentication Generator in Rails 8 and how to add registration pages, I wrapped up my code into a [Ruby Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/authentication_with_registration_generator) (my first one!)

 It was interesting to learn how to build a Ruby Gem and how generators in Rails work (they're really cool, I should use them more!)
