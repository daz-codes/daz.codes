Unashamedly monkey patching JS numbers, strings, arrays and objects with Ruby methods.

Ruby Doo was born out of my love for Ruby and frustration with JavaScript’s limited native methods. So I built my own utility library — not just as a fix, but as a fun way to bring Ruby’s elegance to the browser.

## Ruby Dooby Doo!

Ruby has loads of really nice methods, now you can use them in JS as well!

Write code like:

```javascript
[1,2,3].last // 3
[1,2,3].count // 3
(21).ordinalize // "21st"
"JavaScript".reverse //m "tpircSavaJ"
[1,2,3].sum.squared // 9
["A","A","C","A","B","A","B"].tally // {"A": 4, "C": 1, "B": 2}
```
