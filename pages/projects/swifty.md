A static site generator that uses Turbo to make a page navigation almost instant. 

Itâ€™s perfect for building personal or small business sites and can also be used to create a simple blog. 

I was inspired  by a talk at Haggis Ruby about Bridgetown and have also utilized the Rails concept of convention over configuration in its design (for example if a layout has the same name as a directory then all pages in that directory will get that layout).

This site is built using Swfity!
