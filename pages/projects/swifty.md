A static site generator that uses Turbo to make a page navigation almost instant.

Itâ€™s perfect for building personal or small business sites and can also be used to create a simple blog. In fact, this site is built using Swfity!

I was inspired  by a talk at Haggis Ruby about [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com) and have also utilized the [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) concept of [convention over configuration](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine#convention-over-configuration) in its design (for example if a layout has the same name as a directory then all pages in that directory will get that layout).
