[source code](https://github.com/daz-codes/priority-rails)

This is a Rails project, built using Rails 8.

It allows you to create tasks in one big list and sort it by priority. You can snooze any tasks you don't want to think about at the moment and then go into PR!OR!TY! mode and focus on your top 3 tasks.

Sign up and give it a try [here](https://priority-list.app)!
